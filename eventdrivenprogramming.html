    <h1>Event Driven Programming</h1>
    <h2>What are the different styles of programming</h2>
    <p>There are many types of programming styles, four of which are  Sequential <br>
        programming, Object Oriented programming, Event driven programming and Concurrent <br>
        programming. Each has benifits and draw backs, here we'll talk about Event Driven <br>
        Programming.
    </p>

    <h2>Event Driven Programming Explanation</h2>
    <p>Event driven programming is a stype of programming, where the program is designed to <br>
        respond to events.<br>
        <br>
        These events can be interations with a user, or with the environment, for example a <br>
        button being pressed, entry into a text box or a sensor detecting the outside <br>
        temperature.<br>
        <br>
        Each event will have an appropriate response, this response is linked to the event by<br>
        an event handler which performs an action by triggering a call back function.<br>
        <br>
        As an event can happen at any time, the event handler is 'active' within a loop and so <br>
        i always 'listening'<br>
        <br>
        In contrast to sequential programming, event driven programming is <br>
        non-deterministic. The control and flow of a program can is decided by events which <br>
        trigger functions, but the timing of each function has infinite possibly permutations <br>
        and the possible paths of even a small program may be imposiible to map out <br>
        completely.<br>
        <br>
        the fact that it is non-deterministic leads to uncertainty so rather than <br>
        understanding a program in the way we can understand a sequential program, <br>
        understanding what might happrn at what point in time, we can understand a program by<br>
        determining the state of the program.<br>
        <br>
        If we were to look at a simple program which uses an event driven program to turn on <br>
        a lightbulb when a switch is pressed. The state of the program before the switch is <br>
        pressed is a light that is turned off. The state after the switch being pressed is<br>
        that the light is turned on.<br>
        <br>
        The number of states however can get very large very quickly. If there were for <br>
        example 20 switches for 31 different devices, all with two states, on and off, we <br>
        have 2 to the power of 31 possible states that the program could find itself in, <br>
        being 2,147,483,648 which is more than 2 billion.<br>
        <br>
        States and events can be described using state diagams as shown in the next lesson.
