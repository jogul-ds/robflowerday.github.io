    <h1>K-Neareset Neighbors</h1>
    <h2>What is KNN</h2>
    <p>K-Nearest Neighbors or KNN is a Classification model, which means it learns from 
        labeled data, e.g. using email content and sender to detect whether an email is 
        spam or not.
        
        We'll go through the intuition of how a knn classifier works, then we will code one up.
    </p>

    <h2>Importing the Data</h2>
    <p>In this lesson we will use a dataset called the iris dataset which can be found in<br> 
        the sci-kit learn API. This is a very popular library for Machine Learning, as you<br> 
        progress through the course you will see why.<br>
        <br>
        To import the dataset use the following commands<br>
        <br>
        from sklearn import datasets<br>
        iris = datasets.load_iris()<br>
        <br>
        This will give you a dictionary, the dictionary holds several keys, the names of which<br>
        can be accessed with the command<br>
        <br>
        iris.keys()<br>
        <br>
        They consist of:<br>
            data<br>
            target<br>
            target_names<br>
            DESCR<br>
            feature_names<br>
            filename<br>
            <br>
        data: gives the feature data that we will be used to train our model and make<br>
            predictions of the target variable, in this case the observations of <br>
            sepal width, sepal length, petal width and petal length of 3 species of plants<br>
        target: the actual values (labels) of the target variables, in this case species of<br>
            plant<br>
        target_names: the different possible values that the target variable can take<br>
        DESCR: A description of the dataset<br>
        feature_names: the names of the columns (features) in the dataset, in this case - <br>
            sepal width, sepal length, petal width and petal length<br>
        filename: the path where the csv file containing the data is stored on your machine<br>
    </p>

    <h2>How KNN works</h2>
    <p>A KNN classifier predicts the label of a given datapoint by finding the 'k' nearst<br>
        labeled data points, where k is decided by the programmer, and labeling the datapoint <br>
        with the most common label of the k points. Essentially giving each of the k neighbors <br>
        a vote, and going with the majority.</p>

    <h2>Visualising KNN</h2>
    <p>KNN is easiest visualised when we only work with 2 feauture variables (so that we can <br>
        visualise it in 2d on a graph). as well as using a scatter plot where we can colour <br>
        the data points by the target variable.</p>
