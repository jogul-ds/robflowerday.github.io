    <h1>Different Types of Databases</h1>
    <h2>SQL</h2>
    <p>An SQL database is a database that holds tabular data</p>
    <h2>NoSQL</h2>
    <p>There are now many different types of NoSQL databases, these 
        are databases that do not use the SQL query language. One of 
        the most popular no SQL databsases is MongoDB. Rather than 
        holding tables of data, a MondoDB database holds collections 
        which inturn hold documents which can either hold sub 
        documents or fields directly. There are other NoSQL database 
        management systems like casandra and Apache HBase. But here 
        we will speak only about MongoDB</p>
