    <h2>When to use a jupyter notebook</h2>
    <p>Though there are many possible uses of a Jupyter notebook, 
        I have personally found them best suited when using Python3
        during the building of a project as you can test each part
        individually without running the whole project. This is 
        also useful when having to read in data or train a model, 
        as this can be done only once whilst being able to run 
        other sections of the code as many times as is needed. 
        Jupyter Notebooks also has the benifit of using an ipython
        interpreter which has a range of benifits.<br>To make a 
        bigger project with python I would highly recommend using a 
        different development environment such as Visual Studio Code 
        or Pycharm and using version control via github to save 
        backups at useful points in the project.

        How to open a jupyter notebook in a web browser on windows
    </h2>
    <p>though this tutorial is for windows users, the process is 
        similar for other operating systems, the main difference 
        being the commands used in the command line<br>There are 3 
        common ways to open a jupyter notebook. I will speak about 
        using the command line. To find out about other options 
        please refer to 
        <a href="https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/opening-a-jupyter-notebook-on-windows.html">
          or use a google search
        </a>
        .<br>Almost everything in Jupyter Notebooks works the same 
        as with the regular ipython interpreter 
        <a href="learnipython.html">(see how to use the ipython 
        interpreter)</a>
        .<br>To install python libraries in jupyter notebookes use 
        !pip install (name of module) instead of pip install (name 
        of module). This is the same with conda install.
