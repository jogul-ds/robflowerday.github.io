    Eclipse for Java
UOY_Icon_Introduction_WB.pngInstall Eclipse for Java
An integrated development environment (IDE) can be used to access the JDK. This programme uses Eclipse, as it is a freely-available and widely-used IDE.

The most appropriate download is the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers".

Download Eclipse installer
This will provide a smaller "installer" program which will download and manage future updates of the Eclipse software and set up an application launcher menu item.

Go to the Eclipse IDE Installer download page https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer  to download and for further details about the installation process.

Direct download of Eclipse IDE
This will provide a stand-alone ("portable") IDE which can be extracted from the archive and run in-place.

Go to the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers download page https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-12/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers , then select the download appropriate for your platform. You will have to extract the files from the archive to an appropriate location. You can then run the software directly; keep in mind that this won't set up an applications menu item.

Alternatives
Eclipse is also available for Windows using Chocolatey https://chocolatey.org/  (eclipse-java-oxygen), for macOS using Homebrew https://brew.sh/  (eclipse-java), and for Linux via your distribution's package manager.

 

Note: the Software Engineering module requires the JUnit add on. This should be included in recent versions of Eclipse, but if you have an older version you may need to update Eclipse. See the Software Engineering module for more guidance.
