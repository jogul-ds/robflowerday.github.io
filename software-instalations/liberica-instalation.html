        UOY_Icon_Introduction_WB.pngInstall JDK11
        The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications.
        
        For this programme, you will need Liberica JDK 11 with OpenJFX. Please make sure you do not install JDK12.
        
        What to download
        There are multiple options, so make sure that you download the right version:
        
        Links below are for the 11.0.7 version, but all JDK 11 sub-versions are compatible. You should update to the latest release as it becomes available, as updates usually include security-related fixes.
        You need the Full version (Normal and Lite versions don't include OpenJFX). If you're downloading directly from the Liberica 11.0.7 page https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/  instead of using links below, scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the Full versions.
         You need the JDK version for development (not JRE, this is only for running software).
        See below for links directly to Windows and Linux versions. Additional OS versions are available from the Liberica 11.0.7 page https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/ .  For detailed installation instructions, see the Liberica 11.0.7 installation guidance https://bell-sw.com/pages/liberica_install_guide-11.0.7/
