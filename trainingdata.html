    <h1>Training Data and Train Test Split</h1>
    <p>In the previous lesson we learnt how to train a classifier on 
        a dataset and create predictions on new data. In the real world 
        however, more often than not, we will not be given a set of data 
        to train our model on and a set with which to make predictions. 
        Instead we are given one dataset and we have to create these 
        datasets from it.

        This new datasets are called training sets and holdout or
        testing sets.

        To create a these two dataset from a single dataset, we want to 
        split our two, with a percentage of our data becoming our 
        training set, and the remainder becoming our test set.

        Sci-kit-learn has a useful function that can perform this for us.
        train_test_split().

        This function takes 2 neccessary arguments, the feauture and 
        target data you would like to split, and several optional 
        arguments, including the test_size, being the proportion of 
        your data that the function uses as data for your test set, 
        the train_size, being the same as the test size, but for your 
        training set, the random_state, being a seed with which you 
        could recreate the data your function produces if you choose 
        by passing the same argument, shuffle, which if set to True, 
        shuffles your data before performing the split and stratify, 
        which will ensure there is the same proportionof each target 
        label in the test set and train set as there is in the 
        actual data.

        The output of train_test_split is 4 values and therefore should 
        be unpacked into 4 values, these values are the feature data in 
        the training set, the feature data in the test set, the target 
        data in the training set and the target data in the test set.

        An example of this is given below, importing the iris dataset 
        as in the previous lesson.
