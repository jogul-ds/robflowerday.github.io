    <h1>Tpyes of Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>There are three main subsets of Machine Learning. Supervised Learning, Unsupervised 
        Learning and Reinforcement Learning. They all try to use data to infer a 
        (usually benificial) outcome, prediction or action.
    
        The aim of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning is predict a target variable. This 
        could be the price of a house, the species of a plant or the price of a stock, 
        using feature data. This is data we already know, for example, the number of rooms 
        and location of a house, the petal length and height of a plant or the previous 
        days stock price.

        Both supervised and unsupervised learning aim to solve these and other problems by 
        minimising a loss function. This is a mathematical function which determines how well 
        the model performs. For example, the loss function for a model that predicts house 
        prices may be measuring the loss as the difference between the actual price and the 
        predicted price of the house. We will speack more about loss functions late in the 
        course.
   
    <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
    <p>Supervised Learning is used on labeled data (data for which we know the possible values 
        of the target variable).

        Classification models are created to solve classification problems. These models can 
        be called Classifiers. 'Once trained' (we'll get to that in the next lesson). 
        A Classifier takes unlabeled feature data as input and outputs a prediction of the 
        'correct' label for that data.

        There are two main types of supervised learning problems. Classification and 
        Regression.

        Classification problems are problems where the labeled data are discrete. This means 
        there is a finite amount of values the target variable can take. In program this 
        data is ussually represented as catagorical or boolan data types.

        Regression problems are such that the labeled data is continuous. This means the 
        range of values the data can take is continous, and therefore infinite 
        (or may as well be). We ussually consider price data continuous as though it is 
        technically discrete, there is such a wide range of values that are measured in a 
        logical order (using the number system) that it is for practical purposes a 
        continuous dataset.
    
        2 examples of supervised learning models are:
        
        House Price Prediction:

        predicting the price of a house given the number of rooms it has, the city it is in 
        and the crime rate in the city
        
        The feature data here are the number of rooms in the house, the city it is in and 
        the crime rate in the city

        The target data here is the price of a house

        This is a Regression problem because the target data is (for all intensive purposes) 
        continuous.

        Spam Email Prediction:

        predicting weather an email is spam based on the email address of the sender, the 
        subject line, the content of the email and the time of day the email was sent.

        The feature data here is the email address of the sender, the subject line, the 
        content of the email and the time of day the email was sent.

        The target data is whether or not the email is spam

        This is a Classification problem because the target data is discrete, having only 
        two possible options (spam or not spam).
    </p>

    <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
    <p>Unsupervised learning is the task of clustering data into groups based on similarities 
        or insights drawn from the feature data. It uses unlabed data meaning the target data 
        it is trying to predict (the cluster / group the data should be put into) is not 
        previously known.

        Though we can use supervised learning on the above problem of predicting spam email 
        by assuming there are two cluster and not giving the model information about whether 
        the emails are spam or not. Unsupervised learning models are more useful for problems 
        like the clusetering news articles by their content with similar news articles. This 
        can be used on news sites to recommend similar articles to the one you may be reading 
        without a human needing to know what each article is about (which may enatail a 
        laborious process of labelling the genre of each new article).
    </p>

    <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
    <p>Instead of having a 'fixed' set of data to learn from, reinforcement learning uses an 
        agent that collects data from its environment. (an agent being an entity in an 
        environment like a person in a bar, the person being the agent and the bar being the 
        environment, or mario in a mario level with mario being the agent and the level being 
        the environment)
        
        The reinforcement leaning model is trying to maximize a reward function. This reward 
        function could for example be the score on a mario level given a vertain strategy of 
        playing.

        The agent interacts with the environment to gain information which it uses to inform 
        the agents future decisions and moves. It does this in either an exploratory, or an 
        explotitave manner.

        When doing so in an exploititative manner, it will choose the next decision based on 
        what decision it believes will give it the greatest reward.
        
        When acting on an exploratory manner, it acts in a sub optimal way to gain more 
        information about its surroundings and how they effect the reward it can gain from 
        any particular move, or set of moves.

    <h1>Important Note</h1>
    <p>In this course, though I may touch on the following topics, I do not intend to 
        explain them here in great detail. collecting data, cleaning data and dealing with 
        messy data, visualising data or exploratory data analysis.
    
        This does not mean that they are unimportant, infact they are all of great importance. 
        So much so that they deserve their own course.
    
        I have not made a course on these yet, but until I do many excelent courses and 
        tutorials can be found for there topics online.</p>
